# Tensorflow_ANN_homeprice_predictions
Home Price Prediction using TensorFlow
    A machine learning project that predicts home prices using a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras.

This repository contains code for training and deploying a TensorFlow model that predicts house prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and proven variables for market trends. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps necessary for a neural network problem in machine learning.
